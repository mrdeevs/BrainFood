# Brain Food: A News Reader & Aggregator for Android powered by Hacker News

This project is a lightweight and efficient way to view the best, top, and newest stories from Hacker News for the Android platform. It supports filtering by category and refreshing. Each story item provides title, url, author, timestamp as well as attempts to show the best image possible (still a work-in-progress, images aren't provided in the JSON payloads for hacker news so I have to scrape HTML). Tapping into a given story will allow a fullscreen preview of the full text. I hope to add saving / liking and a settings page too along with a bunch of other features, and eventually release it to the Google Play store.
